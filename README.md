This repo is for the inventory building / management portion of the service.  Demo is a basic implementation that uses a similar data structure to that of Unpakt.com (that is, top-down and structured) and the master branch represents my first stab at an open-ended template approach.


demo branch is up on heroku [here](http://muvanza.herokuapp.com)
